# Programming Challenge

Welcome!

This repository contains a programming challenge designed to evaluate analytical, problem-solving, and implementation skills. The challenge is divided into subfolders, each with specific tasks and deliverables.

Feel free to use online resources if you have questions or are unsure about some APIs, but please do not copy code directly. If you do, cite the source.

The tasks are independent, so if you get stuck on one, you can move on to the next.

## What is evaluated

- Analytical / problem-understanding / problem-solving skills
- Ability to execute / implement
- OOP / abstraction / composition skills
